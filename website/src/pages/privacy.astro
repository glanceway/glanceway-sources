          Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Glanceway is designed with privacy in mind. The app operates primarily
          on your device. Your selected sources and their settings are stored
          locally. Any API tokens or secrets you provide are stored securely in
          the macOS Keychain and are never transmitted to our servers.
          Information fetched by your sources is processed and stored locally on
          your device.

          All your data — including source configurations, fetched content, and
          preferences — is stored locally on your Mac. API secrets are stored in

        </h2>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Sources you install may connect to third-party APIs and services.
          These connections are initiated by your device based on your source
          configurations. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of
          these third-party services. Please review their respective privacy
          policies.
